# Payload_Fuel_Optimizer
Airline Fuel Payload optimizer using Real data and Machine learning toolbox in Matlab.
Final Goal is to optimize the income based on number of passengers, cargo, flight timing and uplift fuel for any round trip.
First step is to have a data driven model to estimate fuel burn based on selected feature.
We use Matlab Regression Learner app for creating this function. so far until initial version, SVM models showed best performance.

Next step is using Matlab optimization toolbox to find the golbal maximum of the income based on different feature.

Note:
 This is baiscally a demonstration tutorial and is simplifed for educational purposes. It doesnt take acount for many of the real world features and constraints and regulations. You should implement more features by your self.
