# Airline Payload and Fuel Optimization using Machine Learning in MATLAB

## Overview
This project, `Airline Payload and Fuel Optimization`, leverages the power of MATLAB's Machine Learning Toolbox to optimize airline revenue and cost efficiency. It focuses on maximizing income by strategically managing passenger numbers, cargo, flight timings, and fuel uplift for round trips. This optimization is crucial in the context of fluctuating ticket prices and fuel costs in the airline industry.

### Key Features
- **Data-Driven Modeling:** Utilizes real-world airline data to create models that estimate fuel burn, integrating features such as passenger count, cargo weight, and flight schedules.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Employs the MATLAB Regression Learner app, with Support Vector Machine (SVM) models showing excellent performance in initial tests.
- **Optimization Techniques:** Applies MATLAB's Optimization Toolbox to explore the global maximum income. Techniques like Genetic Algorithm, Random Search, Pattern Search, and Fmincon are demonstrated for effective optimization.

## Educational Demonstration
This project will serve as an educational tool in 2021, simplifying certain aspects for demonstrating to students. It doesn't consider all real-world aviation constraints and regulations, offering a foundation to build more complex features.
