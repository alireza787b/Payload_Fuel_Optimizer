# Payload_Fuel_Optimizer
Airline Fuel Payload optimizer using Real data and Machine learning toolbox in Matlab.
The final goal is to optimize the income based on the number of passengers, cargo, flight timing, and uplift fuel for any round trip.
The first step is to have a data-driven model to estimate fuel burn based on selected features.
We use the Matlab Regression Learner app for creating this function. so far until the initial version, SVM models showed the best performance.


The next step is using the Matlab optimization toolbox to find the global maximum income based on different features, which will be covered in this video.
In this video, we will use our SVM model (generated by Matlab in the last video) in an optimization task in Matlab to find the most profitable passenger+fuel+cargo combination. You can use a genetic algorithm, pattern search, and fmicon for this problem.

Note: This is a demonstration tutorial and is simplified for educational purposes. It doesn't consider many real-world features, constraints, and regulations. You should implement more features by yourself.
